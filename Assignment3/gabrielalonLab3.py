Main Code
Given a symbol string to check parse one character at a time.
If the character is an opening delimiter (e.g. (, {, or [)
then it is pushed onto the stack.  When a closing delimiter is
 encountered (e.g. ), }, or ]) the stack is popped.

Implement a stack by using Linked lists.  A push operation is
implemented by inserting a symbol node at the beginning of the list.
A pop operating is implementing by deleting a symbol node from the
beginning of the list (aka the header  or top node).
